# AXI Codility Techincal Interview

A test that was issuedd but never got any feed back on, so presume it was a fake test or they were not inclinded to follow up with people who took their time to answer their interview questions.

If anyone wishes to provide feedback, please feel free.

The test was to take a CSV string and remove rows where any of the columes contained the value NULL.

I provided a simple and more to "real" life coding solution.

The simple solution is what was I aimed for, but decided that this is not how I really code, so here I have provided two solutions, one which is closer to the version of what I would have coded, with a benchmark to identify the differences in the two.

k'Thanks bye...
