# AXI Codility Technical Interview

A test that was issued but never got any feedback on, so I'm presuming it was either a fake test or they were not inclined to follow up with people who took their time to answer their interview questions. Hopefully, enough time has elapsed that they have changed their test now.

If anyone wishes to provide feedback, please feel free.

The test was to take a CSV string and remove rows where any of the columns contained the value NULL.

I provided a simple and more "real" life coding solution.

The simple solution is what I aimed for, but decided that this is not how I code in my day-to-day life, so here I have provided two solutions, one of which is closer to the version of what I would have coded, with a benchmark to identify the differences between in the two.

k'Thanks bye...
